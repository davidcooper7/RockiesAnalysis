### **New Found Statistics We Should Use**

(*This section highlights important stats we should look into when evaluating players. It has explanations of how they are calculated, what websites have that particular stat, why they are important, and where I think they can be applied.*)

#### **OPS (On base + Slugging)** 

Calculated as OBP + SLG, great metric used to evaluate hitters using this singular metric

Can be found on these websites: MLB.com, Baseball Savant, Fan Graphs, Baseball Reference.

Much better than batting average. Could be used to help find patterns of success and failure throughout the Rockies' history. Looking for changes in OPS and underlying reasons why. The only issue with OPS is the SLG is rated at a 4.000 while OBP is rated at 1.000 this means that power hitters can become overrated while contact hitters become underrated. Will need to use other metrics to balance out this issue to help prove our point. OPS also doesn’t adjust for hitting environments, maybe when discussing OPS stick to Coors field for players throughout time to maintain consistency. 

#### **RC (Runs Created)**

This stats calculations is rather complex it would be best to find a calculator for it or the stat already caculated for us. 

This stat is important to show the goal of baseball is to score runs and how effective a player is at scoring runs. It's measured as a counting stat and not a rate so if a player is injured or other factors this will affect their RC totals. This stat is most useful for comparing players from the same season to each other as the environment of how runs are being scored are the same for that time period. There is an interesting stat called RC27 that puts RC into a rate to show how many runs per game they would score by multiplying the denominator by 27 to show how a lineup of 9 of the same player would score per game. This stat could be useful in showing players improvements from year to year compared to other teammates of that year. Could be used at the end when displaying our ranking model of helping to prove the production value of the players chosen because their RC is high this current year and could trend in the right direction. This is not a good stat for showing patterns or trends throughout the years of a single player. 

Where it can be found is FanGraphs and Baseball Reference. 

#### **ISO (Isolated Power)** 

Calculated as (SLG - BA) 

This stat is a great indicator of players who hit for raw power. It's a good rate metric that can be used for telling patterns of hitters throughout different time periods over long stretches of time. It's not a great stand alone metric however and needs others such as OPS or SLG to help determine the hitter being presented. Might be helpful to show how power hitters perform better at Coors since their ISO improves potentially. 

Where it can be found is on Baseball Savant, Baseball Reference, and FanGraphs.

#### **wOBA (Weighted On-Base Average)**
